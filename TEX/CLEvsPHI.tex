     Larry Nance Jr.'s tip-in attempt off an intentionally missed free throw by LeBron Jamesbounced off the rim at the buzzer,
 cutting the Cleveland Cavaliers' comeback against the 76ers just short in a 132-130 loss Friday night.

     As frantic as the finish was, what led up to it was even more remarkable:The Cavs trailed the Sixers by 30 points in the second quarter
and found themselves down by only one with 12.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter.

     Had Cleveland pulled off the victory,it would have marked the biggest comeback of the entire NBA season -- eclipsing the Washington Wizards overcoming a 27-point deficit against the New York Knicks on Feb. 14, 
according to ESPN Stats  Information.
