     New tariffs of Chian on US agricultural products will have
   implications for urban residents on the West Coast,
   not just rural communities, According to the words of experts.

     The 3 billion worth of tariffs from China will hit farmers in Washington State hard,
   but despite the direct impact, thereâ€™s also an indirect impact valued at $3 billion to $4 billion,
   said Perry who has represented Chinese producers and US importers for more than 30 years.

      The situation right now is much serious and some experts expect more ups and downs in the next few months.
    in my opinions, a negotiation should be hold for US and China . It should take much time
    to settle all the conflicts and disagreements for each other which is not only beneficial for
    people between two countries ,but also good for the agriculture in US and China.
