\maketitle
    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckberg says the company is "responsible for the
    content " on its platform.

    That's departure from how internet companies have traditionally
    viewed themselvs --- as neutral platforms generally not responsible
    for what people post and share on their sevices.

    As for my opinions,Facebook ,as a super internet company,has the responsibility
    to undertake moral and legal obligation .Facebook should remove some suspected
    terrorist propaganda before anyone see it and should be albe to remove other
    negative content too.
