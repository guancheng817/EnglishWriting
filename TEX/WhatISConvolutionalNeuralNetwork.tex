  Convolutional Neural Network,CNN,is a kind of feedforward neural network.
  Its artificial neurons can respond to a number of surrounding units in a range of coverage,
  and have excellent performance for large image processing,which include
  convolutional layer and pooling layer.\cite{test2}

  Convolution neural networks design neurons into three dimensions:
   width, height, depth, using the characteristics of input.
   For example, the size of the input image is 32 x 32 x 3 (RGB),
   so the input neuron also has a dimension of 32 x 32 x 3.Here are traditonal
  neural networks pic ~\ref{fig1} and convolutional neural networks pic~\ref{fig2}.
