\maketitle
    The ban launched by the United States on Chinese
  telecom equipment maker ZTE Corpration has caused market worries about
  the trade and investment environment in the US,
  the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.

    Gao Feng, the spokesman for the ministry,
    said that the action against ZTE Corpration will harm the US, too.
    "We hope the US does not try to be too clever,
    or it will only receive a bitter outcome from what it has done."Gao said.

    Actually, it is true that the ban lauched by US on ZTE hurt management of ZTE,
    Maybe it is the crushing blow on ZTE.
    However, on the other hand, it hurt economy and businesses of US in the meantime.
    In a certain level, it is not a good behavior for the benefit of two countries.
