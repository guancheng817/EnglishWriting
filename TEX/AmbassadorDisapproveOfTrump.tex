 Today,I read a article about Nikki Haley,Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki
 who  said Sunday Trump's "communication style" has made her uncomfortable,
and has proven to have complicated relationships in the diplomatic sphere.

"He has his communication style, but you're not hearing me defend that,"
Haley told a CBS interview.Haley illustrated her disagreement with Trump with a tweet in February accusing Latin American countries turning a blind eye on drug trafficking.

"They're laughing at us, so I'm not a believer in that, I want to stop the aid."
Trump said in the tweet, referring to US aid to the region.\cite{test2}

With his unconventional style, Trump has also created strains with American long time allies in Europe and Asia.
