\maketitle
    A US federal judge in California ruled on Monday that Facebook
  will have to face a class action suit over allegations it violated users' privacy
  by using a facial recognition tool on their photos without their explicit consent

    The facial recognition tool, launched in 2010,
  suggests names for people it identifies in photos uploaded by users

   In fact, many websites and apps use Facebook sevices
  to target content and ads, including via the social networks Like and Share
  buttons. THe practice was widespread and companies such as Google
  and Twitter also doing the same.
