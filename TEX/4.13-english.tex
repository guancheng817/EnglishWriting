   April 1,2018 is the 15th anniversary of Leslie Cheung's death due to
   depression.

   Honestly speaking ,in my memory ,I know little about Leslie.Maybe
   the events of Leslie exist in the memory of last genertion.Lots of
   people cherish the memory of Leslie when the death of him comes every
   year.

   I am highly courious about him,therfore,I search for his information
   on the internet.He is a great singer and released many popular albums,
   considered one of the founding fathers of pop music.In the late 1980s,
   he shifted his career foucus to the movie industry and shaped many
   classic roles that no one can rival even to this day.
